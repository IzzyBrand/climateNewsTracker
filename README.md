# redditClimate

This was a project for the Climate Change Seminar (course 6.S898) at MIT. We set out to study the climate skepticism community on reddit. We performed a number of experiments which are explained in more detail in [our writeup](https://izzybrand.github.io/redditClimate/)

### Repo organization

 * Generated data goes in the `data` folder.
 * Generated figures are in the `figures` folder.
 * We provide lists of relevant subreddits in the `subreddits` folder.
 * `util.py` contains a bunch of helper functions
 * `scrape_*.py` generated lists of content
 * All other python scripts generate figures or summarial data
