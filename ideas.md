# TODO

 * Compile a short list of small, relevant subreddits
 * Extract all the authors activate in those subreddits
 * Compile a larger list of relevant subreddits (perhaps find up some way to look up which subreddits our authors are in, histogram results, and threshhold)
 * Create a membership matrix which relates authors and subreddits
 * Attempt to cluster the authors based on their membership vectors
 * PCA the distribution and visualize the clusters (perhaps label the axes)
 * Investigate details about the authors in different clusters
